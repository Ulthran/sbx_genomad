## Introduction

sbx_genomad is a [sunbeam](https://github.com/sunbeam-labs/sunbeam) extension for identifying, assigning, and annotating viruses and plasmids in assemblies. This pipeline uses geNomad to achieve this with additional custom filtering steps that can be ignored if not needed.

## Installation

Extension install is as simple as passing the extension's URL on GitHub to `sunbeam extend`:

    sunbeam extend https://github.com/Ulthran/sbx_genomad

Any user-modifiable parameters specified in `config.yml` are automatically added on `sunbeam init`. If you're installing an extension in a project where you already have a config file, run the following to add the options for your newly added extension to your config (the `-i` flag means in-place config file modification; remove the `-i` flag to see the new config in stdout):

    sunbeam config update -i /path/to/project/sunbeam_config.yml

Installation instructions for older versions of Sunbeam are included at the end of this README.

## Running

To run an extension, simply run Sunbeam as usual with your extension's target rule specified:

    sunbeam run --profile /path/to/project/ all_genomad

### Options for config.yml

  - genomad_db: Path to where genomad should install/pull its database from (directory not a filename)
    
## Installing an extension (legacy instructions for sunbeam <3.0)

Installing an extension is as simple as cloning (or moving) your extension directory into the sunbeam/extensions/ folder, installing requirements through Conda, and adding the new options to your existing configuration file: 

    git clone https://github.com/sunbeam-labs/sbx_genomad/ sunbeam/extensions/sbx_genomad
    cat sunbeam/extensions/sbx_genomad/config.yml >> sunbeam_config.yml
